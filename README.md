# N_Queens
An application that shows the solutions for N-Queens problem.
# The Problem
The goal is to place N chess queens on a chessboard of size N with no two queens attacking each other.
# How to Use The app
The app generates an 8x8 board by default. To change N input it in the text field near "N =" on the upper bar and **press enter**.
That will generate a new board and clear the queens (if any). N can be only a positive integer other than 2 and 3 (There are no solutions for 2x2 and 3x3 boards).
Buttons on the upper bar trigger an algorithm and show a solution of the problem. The time that the algorithm took is shown in nanoseconds at bottom bar of the app.
## system requirements
